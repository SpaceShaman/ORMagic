The main goal of ORMagic is to provide a simple and easy-to-use ORM for [Python](https://www.python.org/), that is easy to understand and use, while still providing the necessary features to interact with a database.
Is based on the [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) model and extends it with the ability to interact with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database.

## Simple example

```python
from ormagic import DBModel

class User(DBModel):
    name: str
    age: int

User.create_table()

User(name="John", age=30).save()

User.get(name="John")
>>> User(id=1, name='John', age=30)
```

## Changelog

<!--changelog-start-->
Changes for each release are thoroughly documented in [release notes](https://github.com/SpaceShaman/ORMagic/releases)
<!--changelog-end-->

## Contributing

<!--contributing-start-->
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
I would like to keep the library to be safe as possible, so i would appreciate if you cover any new feature with tests to maintain 100% coverage.

### Install in a development environment

1. First, clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:SpaceShaman/ORMagic.git
    ```

2. Install poetry if you don't have, here you can find the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

3. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ORMagic
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

### Run tests

If you in the virtual environment, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

You can also run the tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=ormagic
```
