The main goal of ORMagic is to provide a simple and easy-to-use ORM for [Python](https://www.python.org/), that is easy to understand and use, while still providing the necessary features to interact with a database.
The library is in the early stages of development, so it is not recommended to use it in production.
Is based on the [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) model and extends it with the ability to save, read, update and delete data from a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ORMagic
```

## Usage

### Define a model

To define a model, create a class that inherits from `DBModel` and define the fields using Pydantic's field types.

```python
from ormagic import DBModel

class User(DBModel):
    name: str
    age: int

# Create the table in the database
User.create_table()
```

### Save, read, update and delete data

```python
# Save data to the database, this will create a new record or update an existing one if the primary key is already present
user = User(name="John", age=30)
user.save()

# Read data from the database
user = User.get(id=1)
>>> User(id=1, name='John', age=30)

# Read all data from the database
users = User.all()
>>> [User(id=1, name='John', age=30), User(id=2, name='Alice', age=25), ...]

# Delete data from the database
user.delete()

# Update data
user = User.get(id=1)
user.age = 31
user.save()

# Filter data and retrieve multiple records
users = User.filter(age=31)
>>> [User(id=1, name='John', age=31), User(id=2, name='Alice', age=31), ...]
```

### Define foreign keys

To define a foreign key, use other models as fields in the model.
By default, the foreign key will be set to `CASCADE`, but you can change it by setting the `on_delete` parameter of the pydantic field to one of the following values: `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, `RESTRICT`, `SET DEFAULT`, `NO ACTION`.

```python
from ormagic import DBModel

class User(DBModel):
    name: str

class Post(DBModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    user: User # Define a foreign key with default on_delete=CASCADE

User.create_table()
Post.create_table()

user = User(name="John")
user.save()

Post(title="Hello", content="World", user=user).save()

# You can also save child models with new parent object in one step, this will save the parent object first and then the child object
Post(title="Hello", content="World", user=User(name="Alice")).save()
```

#### Define foreign key with custom on_delete

```python
from ormagic import DBModel, DBField

class User(DBModel):
    name: str

class Post(DBModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    user: User = DBField(on_delete="CASCADE")
    user: User = DBField(on_delete="RESTRICT")
    user: User = DBField(on_delete="NO ACTION")
    user: User = DBField(on_delete="SET DEFAULT", default=1)
    user: User = DBField(on_delete="SET NULL", default=None)

User.create_table()
Post.create_table()
```

### Unique constraints

To define a unique constraint, use the `unique` parameter set to `True` in the Pydantic field.

```python
from ormagic import DBModel, DBField

class User(DBModel):
    name: str
    email: str = DBField(unique=True)
```

You can also use the `unique` parameter to define one to one relationships between tables.

```python
from ormagic import DBModel, DBField

class User(DBModel):
    name: str

class UserProfile(DBModel):
    user: User = DBField(unique=True)
    bio: str
```

### Deleting and updating tables

To delete a table, use the `drop_table` method.

```python
User.drop_table()
```

To update a table, use the `update_table` method. (Not implemented yet)

```python
User.update_table()
```

### Many-to-many relationships

To define a many-to-many relationship, use list of other model as a field in the model.

```python
from ormagic import DBModel

class Player(DBModel):
    name: str
    teams: list["Team"] = []

class Team(DBModel):
    name: str
    players: list[Player] = []

Player.create_table()
Team.create_table()

player0 = Player(name="Messi").save()
player1 = Player(name="Ronaldo").save()

Team(name="Barcelona", players=[player0, player1]).save()

Team.get(id=1)
>>> Team(id=1, name='Barcelona', players=[Player(id=1, name='Messi'), Player(id=2, name='Ronaldo')])
```

### Filtering data

To filter data and retrieve multiple records, use the `filter` method.
There are several filter options available:

#### Equal

```python
User.filter(name="John")
```

#### Not equal

```python
User.filter(name__ne="John")
```

#### Greater than

```python
User.filter(age__gt=30)
```

#### Greater than or equal

```python
User.filter(age__gte=30)
```

#### Less than

```python
User.filter(age__lt=30)
```

#### Less than or equal

```python
User.filter(age__lte=30)
```

#### Like (Pattern matching with % and _)

```python
User.filter(name__like="%Cat%")
```

#### Not like (Pattern matching with % and _)

```python
User.filter(name__nlike="%Cat%")
```

#### In (List of values)

```python
User.filter(name__in=["John", "Alice"])
```

#### Not in (List of values)

```python
User.filter(name__nin=["John", "Alice"])
```

#### Between (Two values)

```python
User.filter(age__between=[30, 40])
```

#### Not between (Two values)

```python
User.filter(age__nbetween=[30, 40])
```

### Integration with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

Because ORMagic is based on [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev), it can be easily integrated with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
Below is an example of how to use ORMagic with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to create a simple CRUD REST API.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ormagic import DBModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(DBModel):
    name: str
    age: int

User.create_table()

@app.post("/users/")
def create_user(user: User):
    return user.save()

@app.get("/users/")
def read_users():
    return User.all()

@app.get("/users/{id}")
def read_user(id: int):
    return User.get(id=id)

@app.put("/users/{id}")
def update_user(id: int, user: User):
    user.id = id
    return user.save()

@app.delete("/users/{id}")
def delete_user(id: int):
    User.get(id=id).delete()
    return {"message": "User deleted"}
```

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Why?

There are many ORMs for Python, but most of them are too complex or have too many features that are not needed for simple projects.
